# Welcome

I head the Bioinformatics Group at the Opthlamic Genomics and Visual Function Branch (OGVFB) of the National Eye Institute. It is a group of one, responsible for analysis of NGS data in the branch. Research interests include (re)analysis of public genomics data sets and genetic variant prioritization in human disease. 

I use bash, python (when necessary), and R (when possible) to get work done.
