<div id="version-tracking" class="section level2">
<h2>Version Tracking</h2>
<p>We use git.</p>
<p>You will use git.</p>
<p>You will have your own github.com (or equivalent, like gitlab) account.</p>
<p>Your projects will each have their own repository on github.com.</p>
</div>
<div id="language" class="section level2">
<h2>Language</h2>
<p>I use a combination of R, python, Snakemake, awk, and bash. I lean heavily on R to produce
visualizations and interactive documents/sites and Snakemake to reproducibly process data
in projects.</p>
<p>Projects you do with me will likely have to be written in some combination of the
above languages, so they can be supported after you leave (or youâ€™ll have to
talk me into learning language X).</p>
</div>
<div id="reproducibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Reproducibility</h2>
<p>Everything you do is to be written in code. The expectation is you can run
(ideally one) script/Snakemake file and reproduce virtually all of the downstream
analyses from the <strong>raw</strong> data.</p>
</div>
