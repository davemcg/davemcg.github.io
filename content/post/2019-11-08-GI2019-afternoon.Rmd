# Day 3 - Session 8 - EVOLUTION AND PHYLOGENETICS

Genome Informatics 2019 at CSHL

**Bold** is the speaker

**If you dislike/disagree with my notes/sentiment and you are the speaker/PI then contact me. I very much could be mis-understanding some important points.**

# Is pathogen evolution predictable? The role of population genomics
**William Hanage.**

Is pathogen evolution predictable?

  - Probably not
  - Cool, talk over, I guess.
  
Oh he is still going

"Accessory genome"
  
  - three *e. coli* strains only share 39% of the genes
    - Welsh et al.......2001 (?)
  - the "mr. potato head" model
  
Sample 4k+ pneumococcal genomes from 4 dif places
  
  - Corander Nat Eco Evol 2017
  - found 73 "sequence clusters" based on population (tree?) structure
  - also 1700+ accessory genes (COGS)
  
**Dif strains are correlated when using accessory genes (was effectively R^2 of 0 with full genome)**

Negative Frequency Dependent Selection

  - balancing selection
  - corrolary are antigens/phage receptors - if too common get ID'ed and wiped out

Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccines (PCVs) as an evolutionary experiment

  - we have good vaccines against *some* strains
  - 7
  - but there are 90+ serotypes

Can we predict what types will persist/succeed after vaccination?


Sampling (seq.) per/post vaccination

  - 35 strains found
  - vaccination wiped out the 7 that were covered
  - uneven "replacement" rate by other strains
    - not super convinced ... is this just noise?
    
Isolates in the same group tend to have the same set of COGS (getting increasingly concerned I don't know what COGS stands for...)

Check for prevalence of COGS pre/post vaccination and sum distance from linear expected. 

  - directional
  
Can predict fitness ... and it roughly matches what you'd expect. Not perfect, but the correlation looks real.

What are the genes?! (<- his formatting)

  - aaaah, he didn't say.
  - tease
