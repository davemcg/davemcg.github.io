# Night 1
## Comparative 3D genome organization in Apicomplexan parasites
Evelien M. Bunnik, Aarthi Venkat, Ferhat Ay, **Karine G. Le Roch.**

Apicomplexan parasites:

  - toxoplasma gondii
  - babesia
  - most prevalent nad morbidity causing pathogens
  
Try to understand at genomic level

Malaria (plasmodium) genome published 18 years ago

  - 82% AT rich
  - grab bag of major -omics techniques
  - still poor understanding of gene regulation
  - believe under-representation of TFs identified (lower rate than human, yeast)
  
Did Hi-C (chrmatin conformation capture)

  - at many stages
  - 100kb resolution (at least for later work?)
  - going through their literature of chromosome organization (Ay, Bunnik Genome Research 2014)
  
*Virulence* Genes

  - mediates adherence of infected RGC to endothelium of infected RBC
  - altered chromatin structure at some of these genes

More examples of loops for other pathogenesis processes
  
  - see power of doing many stages (stage specific patterning of contact maps)
  
Did more Hi-C across other parasites, unfortunately had to re-assemble several genomes 

  - Bunnik PNAS 2019
  - more expression at genes near (in 3D space) telomore 
  - which is where many virulence genes are ...
  
## Unscrambling the tumor genome via integrated analysis of structural variation and copy number
**Daniel L. Cameron**, Charles Shale, Jonathan Baber, Anthony T. Papenfuss, Peter Priestly.

Hartwig has a fully automated oncology report ("no touch")

  - needs to be highly sensitive and specific 
  - use 110x tumor, 45x germline
  - SV and CNV calling not ideal
  
GRIDSS -> PURPLE -> LINX

SV-> CNV -> Interpretation

https://github.com/PapenfussLab/gridss 

full pipeline: https://github.com/hartwigmedical/gridss-purple-linx

work on phasing SV (cis vs trans vs unknown)

 - only good up to about 300bp
 - but events are clustered, so works better than you'd expect
 
 Benchmarking (includes GRIDSS)

## Tissue-specific enhancer functional networks for associating distal regulatory regions to disease
**Xi Chen**, Jian Zhou, Chandra L. Theesfeld, Ran Zhang, Aaron K. Wong, Olga G. Troyanskaya.

How to predict function of enhancers?

Different ways enhancers associated with disease:

  - enhancer -> gene (near)
  - enhancer(with SNP inside)
  - enhancer(rare mutation inside)
  - enhance without direct evidence
  
Hypothesis:

  - enhancer will have a functional relationship with another enhancer if:
    - 3d interaction
    - co-activation with TF
    - regulate related genes
  - if all met, then *maybe* disease associated
  
bayesian inference to model the above assumptions

how to see if this sort of works?

  - check brain specific super enhancers in non-brain tissues
  - get some enrichment
  
https://fenrir.flatironinstitute.org

  - web tool
  - no preprint or paper?
  
dmcg note:
  
  - seems like you'd really want some en-masse validation. validating a few sites doesn't seem like enough. 
  - i missed what the input data for these models are (public stuff? Internal stuffs?)

  
## Targeted Nanopore sequencing with Cas9 for studies of methylation, structural variants, and mutations
*Timothy E. Gilpatrick*, Isac Lee, Fritz J. Sedlazek, Winston Timp.

Want to enrich regions for genome


ROI -> cut out with CRISPR (cas9 on both sides of ROI) -> dA tail -> adapter ligate

 - oh even cutting just once helps with enrichment. cool.
 - can target 10 sites simulateously (400X+ coverage with MinION)
 
Tried with cancer model

On-target perentage (reads) is about 1-4%

  - most off-target randomly distributed
  - very little off-target cutting
  
5% error rate!

  - homopolymers sucks
  - guppy v3 does better job at SNV calling
  
did downsampling test to check SNV performance

  - tools
    - mpileup
    - Nanopolish (Simpson et al. ?)
    - Medaka (ONT)
    - Clair (Luo et al.)
  - can get 95% sesnitivity...doesn't seem to great
  - Clair gets worse with more coverage (trained on 25X apparently)
  
HE IS GOING SO FAST OMG
  
More discussion of benchmarking
  - still in SNV calling
  
Now we are talking phasing

  - in TP53 find all true variants, no FP

Suggestion of CNV with phased data, more copies of one allele (60X vs 20X)

Now CpG

  - enriched stuff can still get detectable CpG calls

SV & Repetitive

  - still works

dmcg note:
  
  - everything still works (isn't that expected?)
  - on-target percentage VERY low (1-4% means you are "throwing" **lots** of data away)
  - and yield is getting hammered...so doubly bad
  - not doing anything like getting hundreds of genes...which I would think would be really necessary to be useful clinically
  - size smaller? (length of DNA reads)
