## Comparative 3D genome organization in Apicomplexan parasites
Evelien M. Bunnik, Aarthi Venkat, Ferhat Ay, **Karine G. Le Roch.**

Apicomplexan parasites:

  - toxoplasma gondii
  - babesia
  - most prevalent nad morbidity causing pathogens
  
Try to understand at genomic level

Malaria (plasmodium) genome published 18 years ago

  - 82% AT rich
  - grab bag of major -omics techniques
  - still poor understanding of gene regulation
  - believe under-representation of TFs identified (lower rate than human, yeast)
  
Did Hi-C (chrmatin conformation capture)

  - at many stages
  - 100kb resolution (at least for later work?)
  - going through their literature of chromosome organization (Ay, Bunnik Genome Research 2014)
  
*Virulence* Genes

  - mediates adherence of infected RGC to endothelium of infected RBC
  - altered chromatin structure at some of these genes

More examples of loops for other pathogenesis processes
  
  - see power of doing many stages (stage specific patterning of contact maps)
  
Did more Hi-C across other parasites, unfortunately had to re-assemble several genomes 

  - Bunnik PNAS 2019
  - more expression at genes near (in 3D space) telomore 
  - which is where many virulence genes are ...
  
## Unscrambling the tumor genome via integrated analysis of structural variation and copy number
**Daniel L. Cameron**, Charles Shale, Jonathan Baber, Anthony T. Papenfuss, Peter Priestly.

Hartwig has a fully automated oncology report ("no touch")

  - needs to be highly sensitive and specific 
  - use 110x tumor, 45x germline
  - SV and CNV calling not ideal
  
GRIDSS -> PURPLE -> LINX

SV-> CNV -> Interpretation

https://github.com/PapenfussLab/gridss 

full pipeline: https://github.com/hartwigmedical/gridss-purple-linx

work on phasing SV (cis vs trans vs unknown)

 - only good up to about 300bp
 - but events are clustered, so works better than you'd expect
 
 Benchmarking (includes GRIDSS)
