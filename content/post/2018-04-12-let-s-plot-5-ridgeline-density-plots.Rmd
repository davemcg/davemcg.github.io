# Intro
For this installment of Let's Plot (where anyone can make a figure!), we'll be making the hottest visualization of 2017 - the *joy plot* or *ridgeline plot*. 

Joy plots are partially overlapping density line plots. They are useful for densely showing changes in many distributions over time / condition / etc. 

This type of visualization was inspired by the [cover art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures) from Joy Division’s album Unknown Pleasures and implemented in the R package [ggridges](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges) by Claus Wilke.

While the original term for this plot took off as *joy plot* it has since been changed to a *ridgeline plot* or *ridges plots*, as discussed at length [here](http://serialmentor.com/blog/2017/9/15/goodbye-joyplots). 

Anyways, Claus has a *beautiful* intro to his package [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/gallery.html). I will not reproduce any of his plots, as I want you to click the link. Plus they are way cooler looking than what we will be making. Which is real(ish) data from people in my division. 

# Load Davide merged data
This is a highly cut down version of his original data - which is a 160mb csv file. The csv for this exercise can be found [here](https://github.com/davemcg/Let_us_plot/blob/master/005_ggridges/davide_cell_size_data.csv).

It contains cell area size for thousands of cells which have had a drug perturbation, split by wells in a dish. One drug per well. 
```{r, echo = T,warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
merged.df <- read_csv('~/git/Let_us_plot/005_ggridges/davide_cell_size_data.csv')
```

# What does the data look like? 
```{r}
head(merged.df)
```

# First we create a fake DMSO to match each drug so we can see the 'null' distribution matched with each drug in the visualization below
I know `for` loops are out of trend, but I find them easier to write *and* read compared to `purrr`. A lot less compact, I concede. 

This is a bit hacky, but I want to duplicate the DMSO data and assign it to each drug. Later we'll be splitting the plot by drug, so we can see both the drug data *and* the DMSO data in the section. 
```{r}
# for background DMSO plot
fake_DMSO_drug <- data.frame()
for (i in (merged.df$Drug %>% unique())){
  print(i)
  fake_DMSO_drug <- rbind(fake_DMSO_drug, merged.df %>% filter(Drug=='DMSO') %>% mutate(Drug = i, Well.names=paste0('0DMSO_', i), DMSO='Yes'))
}

# order drugs by median area
drug_order <- merged.df %>% group_by(Drug) %>% summarise(MedianArea=median(Area)) %>% arrange(MedianArea) %>% pull(Drug)
```

# ridgeline plot, showing each well separately
Several wells got the same drugs. So there are multiple plots per drug. 
```{r, fig.height=8}
bind_rows(merged.df %>% mutate(DMSO='No'),fake_DMSO_drug) %>% 
  filter(Drug!='DMSO', Drug!='Pyr') %>% # don't need DMSO plot now and Pyr is empty
  mutate(Drug=factor(Drug, levels=drug_order)) %>% # reorder drugs by drug_order above 
  ggplot(aes(y = Drug, x=log2(Area), group=Well.names, fill=DMSO)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha=0.6) + 
  theme_ridges() + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set1')
```

# Same, but merging all wells together
Now merge all the wells together. Notice how the group is now `Well.names2`
```{r, fig.height=9}

bind_rows(merged.df %>% 
            mutate(DMSO='No', Well.names2=paste0('Orig', Drug)),
          fake_DMSO_drug %>% 
            mutate(Well.names2 = Well.names)) %>% 
  filter(Drug!='DMSO', Drug!='Pyro') %>% # dont' need DMSO plot now and Pyroxamine is empty
  mutate(Drug=factor(Drug, levels=drug_order)) %>% # reorder drugs by drug_order above 
  ggplot(aes(y = Drug, x = log2(Area), group=Well.names2, fill=DMSO)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha=0.6) + 
  theme_ridges() + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set1')

```

# There's a large variation in the number of counts
How did I know? Because a bunch of the density plots were super wavy - which means (almost always) that the number of counts in that sample is very low. Low numbers = high variance. 

So IMR, IMP, Tori, and WYE are *problem* tests. Perhaps they are just killing the cells? Something for Davide to examine.
```{r}
cell_area_counts_by_drug <- merged.df %>% 
  group_by(Drug) %>% 
  summarise(Count=n())

cell_area_counts_by_drug  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Drug, y=Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```
