The concept is simple - I get data from one of the scientists in my group. Or I get my own. Then I demonstrate, step-by-step, how I generate the plot(s). I'll also toss in some *data science* concepts occasionally. 

# Tooling
I like R. I like ggplot. I like the tidyverse. That's what I'll be using. 

# How can I follow along?

1. Download and install R: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
2. Download and install Rstudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
3. In Rstudio install any libraries that throw an error when you run `library (LIBRARYNAME)` with `install.packages(LIBRARYNAME)`
4. Then you can (largely) go line by line through the blog post
