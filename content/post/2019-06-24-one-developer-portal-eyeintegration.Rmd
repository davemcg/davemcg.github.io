## News!
[eyeIntegration](https://eyeIntegration.nei.nih.gov/) version 1.0 went live early this year (2019-01-16) 
and recently was accepted for publication in [IOVS][eyeIntegration](https://eyeIntegration.nei.nih.gov/). In celebration
of the news, I'm posting a small series of posts about the genesis, development, upgrades, and future of 
eyeIntegration. 

You can find our latest manuscript on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/579482v1). The latest update
should go live soon. 

## Background
[eyeIntegration](https://eyeIntegration.nei.nih.gov/) was developed to serve as a 
quick and easy to use *normal* gene expression portal in eye tissues. 

![eyeIntegration](/img/eyeIntegration_shot.png)
The inspiration came from [GTEx](https://gtexportal.org/home/index.html), which contains dozens of 
post-mortem tissue types from hundreds of samples (and samples are people who have donated their
body to science - thanks!). 

Knowing what the *normal* gene expression is a crucial piece of information when 
doing novel gene function research. You are going to be a lot less excited about an interesting
gene if you also know it has zero expression in the retina. 

Since no eye tissues are collected by GTEx, I had to build my own version. The *best*
solution would involve setting up a very expensive study - with a carefully designed 
tissue collection, DNA/RNA extraction, etc. protocols along with huge amounts of paperwork
required when working with people. This would also be very expensive and take multiple
years. 

As I have approximately zero research dollars (see why below), I did the next best thing and just 
grabbed all the publicly available RNA-seq eye samples from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
 / [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) / [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena). 

Since I knew R and did not know any web development stuffs I chose to use [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com)
to build the web portal. In 2016 (my first commit was May 24th, 2016), when this project got started this seemed sort
of nuts to do this. But the documentation was pretty good and it wasn't too hard
to spin up a Shiny server on a linux box I had under my desk. Over the past three years
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) has continued to develop Shiny and I'm feeling
better and better about going this route. 

## What do you mean by `One Developer Portal`?

I work for the National Eye Institute ([NEI](https://nei.nih.gov)), which controls about $700 million dollars 
to fund eye research.

Most of that money goes as grants to the extramural community (e.g. research labs
at your local university). I am a [staff scientist](https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/personnel/ipds-appointment-mechanisms/staff-scientist)
(not a PI/professor - which means I don't have a pot of $ to do research) who was 
hired to provide bioinformatic support / data analysis for a [branch](https://nei.nih.gov/intramural/ogcsb) in NEI. 

[eyeIntegration](https://eyeIntegration.nei.nih.gov/) is a essentially a 
side-project I've done in my "spare time" and is run by myself 
(with important features written by two [post-bacs](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta)
, John Bryan and Vinay Swamy)). It is possible to make and support
a resource like this **because** of [available compute](https://hpc.nih.gov) and great software.

The long-term goal is to keep eyeIntegration current (e.g. take in new samples)
with part-time effort from one person (me) with periodic bursts of activity
to add new features.

This is getting sort of long so I'm going to break it into several pieces:

1. [Making a performant site](/post/one-developer-portal-optimization)
2. What does eyeIntegration 1.0 mean? (future post)
3. Crucial software bits (future post)
4. What will eyeIntegration 2.0 be? (future post)
