# Intro
Very sparse and poorly written notes covering [#BoG18](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BoG18&src=tyah). I've tried to respect #notwitter. Will be updated periodically. 

Speaker (Last Author)

# Genome Engineering and Genome Editing (Tuesday Night)

## Jef Boeke
### Writing Genomes

Building synthetic yeast genomes. Contig/chr one by one. All designed. *Sc2.0*

80+% complete for each of the 16. 

### "dark matter"

Can we use 'big dna' to functionally query mammalian genomes?
'Synthetic haplotypes'

Building dif combinations of haplotype blocks

synthetic hypervariation:

    - query enhancers
    - alt splicing
  
built 102kb locus (human) and put into yeast

    - built in 3kb chunks and can assemble dif combiations
    
### big dna
Can build big dna pieces
CEGS grant
will build 3 100kb+ loci / year
want community input

## Greg Findlay (Jay Shendure)
Accurate classficiation of thousands of BRCA1 variants with saturation genome editing

vous a problem
BRCA1:

  - 4243 clinvar snvs
  - >50% VOUS
    
How to functionally validate?

Use Homology-direct repair (HDR). Can engineer precise edits.

Use a library of SNVs for the HDR

Over time selecdtion removes non functional edits

Each experimente:

  - millions of cells
  - millions of sequencing reads to count SNVs
    
Variable effects at splicing junctions

  - sometimes just 2-3 bp
  - sometimes 9 base pairs
    
also have matched rna-seq data

aberrant splicing causes RNA depletion

matches up really well with clinvar designations

question: 

  - hdr effeciency rate? 10-90% effectiveness

## Stephen Levene (Andrew Fire)
eccDNA is a possible mediator of chromosomal polymorphism at multple loci

'physical chemist by training'

e. coli genome: 1 femtoliter volume

100 fold compaction problem (DNA)

~10k fold for mammalian

Techniques for DNA/chromiatin flexibility:

  - Hi-C
  - FISH
  - SLICE (Beagrie et al Nature 2017)
  
eccDNA (circular dna outside chromosome/nucleus(?))

  - unclear how it forms
  - elevated levels associatd with genome instability
  
how to capture?

  - DNA -> SDS lysis -> isolate gDNA -> cscl gradient -> bottom bit
  - or exoV treatment (leaves circular alone)
  
take pictures of the loops with high resolution microscopy

sequenced a few (**unfortunately with short read illumina**)

modeled with molecular dynamics

## David Truong (Jef Boeke)
Resurrection of Histone H3k27 Me in brewer's yeast by human prc2 and plant atxr6

human pathway reconstruction in yeast

  - avoid pleiotropy (hopefully)
  - more real than *in vitro*
  
Yeast (s. cerevisiae) lost histone mods 

**Adding them back???**

yes

humanize yeast histones

add synthetic human histones

force out wt histones with +5FOA

*20 days later* ..... one colony

Keep growing the colony out

WGS: mutations in cell cycle regulation 

  - bypassing histone cycle checks?

brewer's yeast does not have H3K27 methylation 

  - PRC2 complex (to methylate h3k27)

add the stuffs - what happens?

  - made artifical chr with PRC2 complex
    - and a slightly broken one
  - not much happens in WT yeast
    - no me changes
  - deleted H3k36me3 (might antagonize artificial chr)
    - nope
  - can you jump start with atxr6 (does mono me)?
    - yes (confirmed with mass spec)
      - not super high levels (0.054% tri me)
      
      
## Feng Zhang
Advances in genome editing technologies

two major classes of CRISPR

  - class 1 (multi subunut)
  - class 2 (single subunit crRNA-effector)
  
trying to find new class 2

  - bioinformatic screen with BLAST of cas1
  - found a bunch (Shmakov collaboration)
  
cas13

  - added into e. coli
  - modify to only edit RNA?
  
rna editing

  - reversible
  - nuclease based editing inefficient in post mitotic cells 
  - dCas13 linked with [ADAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAR) (adenosine to inosine) + guideRNA --> A to I conversion in RNA
  - 90+% conversion
  - 1732 off target incidents
    - 925 off target with non-targeting guide!
    - so protein itself is not ideal....
    - identified non-binding residues of ADAR
      - mutated them
  - v2 works better
    - 18385 off target (v1) to 20 (v2)
  - still developing
  
## Molly Gasperini (Jay Shendure)
**my fav of the night**

crisprQTL mapping as a genome-wide association framework for cellular genetic screens
  
lots of guideRNA to made mutations, check for dif in expression

nuclease inactive cas9

want to test all enhancers against all genes

scRNA-seq + guideRNA (multiplex gRNA)

  - thus multiple perturbations per 'assay'
  - 15-30 / cell!
  
targeted 1,119 candidate enhancers

  - 15 guides / cell
  - 47k cells
  - 10X
  - CROP-seq 
  - works really well
  - crisprQTL usually targets closest gene
    - sometimes not....
  - matches up with histone chip-seq
  - 34.3kb average distance from enhancer <-> gene
  
** new data! **
4,801 enhancers

  - built logistic regression model on pilot to pick new candidates
  - 30 guides / cell
  - correlates with pilot

manolis kellis q:

  - why doesn't work so well? expected more
  - what about multiple SNPS / block?
  
## Eilon Sharon (Hunter Fraser)

Testing genetic var effect on fitness using precise genome editing

high throughput edigint

crispey:
cas9 retron precise parallel editing via homology

use bacterial reverse transcriptase and RNA retron to covalently link ssDNA donor to guide-tracrRNA

can insert long sequences

(yeast)

measure fitness of genetic variants (growth competition)

sequence every 2-3 gens

model at linear relative strain abundance / time (generation #)

 # missense var ~ # synonymous var for effecting fitness!

## Luca Pinello
CRISPR-SURF exploratory and interactive software for analyzing CRISPR-base tiling screens

Uncover non-coding functional regions

** Nice overview of CRISPR tiling strategy **
Mutate (tile across region) -> Measure pheno change (somehow) -> Assess (sequence gRNA)

No unified framework to analyze these kind of assays

many challenges

  - biological noise
  - sgRNA efficiencies
  - non-uniform spacing
  - perturbation / assay differences
  - epigenetic perturbation can be wide (changing 200bp or so)  

deconvolve with generalized lasso

fastq -> score -> segmentation -> deconvolution -> region ID

# Population Genomics (Wednesday morning)

## Mattias Joakobsson 

** out of my field here **

Sequence based approaches utilizing complete modern and ancient genomes to investigate early human history

Use full genomes on ancient pops

Population divergence models

```{ascii}
                      X
     +                X
     |                X
     |                X
     |                X
     |               XXXX
     |              XX  XXX
time |           XXX      XX
     |         XXX         XX
     |        XX            XX
     |
     |      A B              C
     |
     v
```

Can model whether discordant or concordant (a,b,c) over time

estimate pop divergence (time) in generations

use genes from different populations to estimate divergence 

  - 'tt method'
  
stone age humans from sourthern africa

  - 13 genomes from 3 people
  - a bit 'right' of yoruba
  - admixture with east africa **missed something**

## Jaemin Kim (Elaine Ostrander?)
Genetic Selection of Athletic Success in Sport Hunting Dogs

WGS of sport hunting (10 breeds), terrier (i breeds), and 'village' dogs (unselected - an outgroup)

  - 14 million SNPs

59 genes under strong selectdion in hunting dogs (compare to terrier and village)

  - blood circulation GO terms
  - and a bunch of 'process' GO terms

ASIC3 - resistance to muscle fatigue? 

  - maybe?
  - a guess based on known gene function (I think)
  
dogs do agility performance competitions

  - made a metric to find breeds good at winning
  - WGS of 92 breeds of 299 dogs
  - ROBO1 significant 3e-4 (FDR corrected? Don't know)
    - neuronal migration, axon guidance
  - 1243 SNP chip
    - dogs classified by agility performance
    - ** do only pure breeds do agility? **
    - ROBO1 SNP AF increases with more winning breeds

racing speeds (whippet)

  - not ROBO1
  - TRPM3 (1.6e-3)
  
CDH23 - increased tolerance to loud noise and low startle reflex
  - **do hunting dogs have poor hearing?**
  
**Useful stuff maybe for competitive dog breeders**

Q (Kellis?): polymorphic nature of traits across dogs. **what's the question?**
A: complex traits, incomplete answers right now
Q (Kellis?): enrollment bias for dogs that will win
A: tried to control by grouping breeds
Q: what kind of mutations?
A: mostly noncoding (**answer in LD I guess**)
Q: project personality onto dog ... look at dog behavior/traits relating to this?
A: try to objectively test dogs (can't trust owners....)
Elaine: people developing stanrdard tests for dogs (yes, owners lie)

## Ipsita Agarwal (Molly Przeworski)
Widespread differences in the mtation spectrum of X and autosomes

Males contrigute more germline mutations than females 

  - epigenetic differences for gamete development (methylation)
  - sperm in mitosis all the time
 
```{ascii}

|                         XX
|                       XXX

|   XXXX XXX  XXXXX
|
+------------------------+
```

Mutation rates get wider as males age (top line male, bottom female)

  - **eyeball 3x worse?**
  
GnomAD:

  - 120 million SNPs
  - 60% singleton (50%) and doubletons (10%) for variants
  
Looked for X-autosome difs

X/A diversity = (mutations(x) / all X) / (mutation(a) / all a)
(a is autosome, x is chrX)

Bootstrap test for mutation types to make null distribution

  - big shift in X (more than expected)
  - T->A and C->A more common in X versus autosome
  
Replication timing

 - inactive X has more mutations
 
Enriched of C>G (meiotic recombination / DSB) mutations

## Amnon Koren
Genetic architecture of human DNA replication origin activity

We have extensive maps of human genomic / epigenomic

But where are replication origins?

  - ** yeah....good q**
  - yeast have them
    - yeast have a DnaA/OriC signatures
  - how to find?
    - many techniques - don't agree well (or at all)
    
different parts of genomic replicate at different rates
  
  - **can measure coverage across time, right**
    - yes
  - sort G / S phase
    - check coverage
  - Did in 2012 with human - but not precise enough (low resolution)
  
Is this a polymorphic trait?

  - skipped cell sorting
  - works well enough
    - and way faster to do
  - **uh, wait, this has been done already (if cells are growing)**
      - again, yes, LCL from 1000G

But still, did WGS >140 hESC lines 
  
  - oooooo, reproduces REALLY well
  - find 'master' ORI that are pretty much always present
      - crucial regions in replication?

GWAS of DNA replication timing

  - 'rtQTL' (replication)

## Sarah Tishkoff
Novel loci associated with skin pigmentation identified in African populations
