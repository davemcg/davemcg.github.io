Typos everywhere. Things may change dramatically over time as I scan back through notes.
I’ve tried to respect #notwitter. Will be updated periodically.

      <description>Background There are several popular naming systems for (human) genes:
RefSeq (NM_000350) Ensembl (ENSG00000198691) HGNC Symbol (ABCA4) Entrez (24)  Given enough time in #bioinformatics, you will have to do every possible combination of conversions.
This post will very briefly explain the most expedient way to automatically convert between these formats with R.

 Ensembl &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; HGNC &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Entrez Stephen Turner has built a small set of data frames (well, tibbles) with core information, including transcript &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; gene info.</description>

      <title>Easy bam downsampling</title>

      <guid>/./post/easy-bam-downsampling/</guid>
      <description>When you have a set of ChIP-seq (like) files, it is sometimes useful to downsample the larger samples to more closely match most of the samples. Tommy Tang goes into more detail in his blog post.
Unfortunately the tool suites I use most for bam files (samtools and picard) only downsample to a percentage. Which isn’t ideal when you want your files to be no more than n reads.
This post is just a slight one-upping of Tommy Tang’s process to easily downsample a bam.</description>

      <description>Intro For this installment of Let’s Plot (where anyone can make a figure!), we’ll be making the hottest visualization of 2017 - the joy plot or ridgeline plot.
Joy plots are partially overlapping density line plots. They are useful for densely showing changes in many distributions over time / condition / etc.
This type of visualization was inspired by the cover art from Joy Division’s album Unknown Pleasures and implemented in the R package ggridges by Claus Wilke.</description>

      <title>Are you in genomics and building models? Stop using ROC - use PR</title>

      <description>tldr Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) is a terrible metric for a genomics problem. Do not use it. This metric also goes by AUC or AUROC. Use Precision Recall AUC.
 Inspiration for this post I am working on a machine learning problem in genomics I was getting really confused why AUROC was so worthless scienceTwitter featuring Anshul Kundaje  I want to save you (some time)   What’s a ROC?</description>

      <description>title: ‘Something Different: Automated Neighborhood Traffic Monitoring’ author: David McGaughey date: ‘2018-03-03’ slug: traffic-monitoring-intro categories: - R - python - raspberry - pi tags: - R - python - raspberry - pi —
Introduction This is, obviously, a personal project. Traffic is a concern in my town. Cut-through, speeding, etc. The town has paid for a couple of (very expensive!) traffic surveys, but the reports are not very useful as the company only sets up in town for a few days (if that) and then only reports stuff like ‘number of cars for a one hour period.</description>

      <description>Introduction Data Cleaning Reformatting Box Plot Boxplot with all the data displayed I used to prefer violin plots I’m a fan of beeswarm plots with boxplots Doing statistics. Session   Introduction The battle that we’ve all been waiting for. Excel vs. R. Bar plot versus a plot that actually shows the data.
Yeah, this isn’t a fair fight.
Bar plots are terrible. Why? Simple. They don’t show what your data looks like.</description>

      <description>Load data Curious? Data How many genes are in this dataset? What genes are in here? How many data points (bases) per gene? How many exons per gene? How many base pairs of ABCA4 (well, ABCA4 exons) is covered by more than 10 reads? 5 reads? Let’s check all of the genes to see which are the worst covered We can visually display the data, also Hard to see what is going on, let’s make little plots for each gene Where are genes poorly covered?</description>

      <description>What is going on? Where to get the code and data? Import data with readxl OK, first let’s remove the notes. However, we aren’t done. The data is “wide” instead of “long” and we have mixed session IDs (Amp 1-3 and Angle 1-3) with the value type. Now we need to extract the session (1,2,3) and the test type (Amp or Angle) Now we have two value types (Angle and Amplitude) in one column.</description>

      <description>Tooling How can I follow along?   The concept is simple - I get data from one of the scientists in my group. Or I get my own. Then I demonstrate, step-by-step, how I generate the plot(s). I’ll also toss in some data science concepts occasionally.
They are a bit sparse on the words because I’m presenting these in person. But I believe they are clear enough for someone to follow along.</description>
